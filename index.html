   <p>Have you ever wondered why there are so many different types of churches?  It's no secret that Christians are a pretty scattered bunch.  Maybe you're tired of the church squabbles around you, and wish you could just find that early church that you read about in the New Testament.</p>
   
   <p>It's been 2,000 years since the time of Jesus, but you probably attend a church that didn't exist until the last couple hundred years.  If the only ancient form of Christianity you've heard of is the Roman Catholic Church, you might be surprised to discover that there's a whole way of being Christian that's largely unknown in America.</p>
   
   <p>The Churches that you've read about in the New Testament in places like Antioch and Corinth are still alive and well today.  This Eastern Church has a very different way of being Christian that we'd like to introduce to you.  Come and experience the refreshing change that comes with diving deeply into the early Church.</p>
   
   <p>We'd love for you to come and experience first hand the beauty and mystery of the Eastern Orthodox Church.  It really is unlike anything you've seen.  We'd also like to offer you a free book, no strings attached.  Just look over the options below and we'll send it to you.  You don't have to visit us, or be visited by us.  Keep the book as our gift to you.  Once you've read it, if you want to know more we invite you to come for a visit and see what we are all about.</p>
